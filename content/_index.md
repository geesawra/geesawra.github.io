# Hi there!

If you found this page, it was through HackerNews or Bluesky.

Something about me:

 - I'm a computer individual with production experience in Go and Rust
 - I'm ~~available for hire!~~ happily employed!
 - I'm a cyclist with a strong passion for dirt-related disciplines
 - I pretend to hear the difference between compressed and uncompressed music files.
